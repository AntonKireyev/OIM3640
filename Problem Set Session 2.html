Suppose you have a variable that keeps track of hourly wage. What is a good variable name to assign?
hourly_wage

In the interactive shell try the following: x = y = 1. What is the value of x and y? 
x = 1
y = 1

In the interactive shell enter y += 3. What is the value of y? what is the value of x?
y = 4
x = 1

x is still one because we haven't re-run the line: x = y = 1.

What is the type of x? What is the type of y? what is the type of y/x?
Both Integers, y/x is a float because division yields a float value.

Show an example of converting a string into an integer. 
In [12]: a = "44"
In [13]: type(a)
Out[13]: str
In [14]: a = int(a)
In [15]: type(a)
Out[15]: int

In [16]: b = 10/2
In [17]: type(b)
Out[17]: float
In [18]: b = "b"
In [19]: type(b)
Out[19]: str
